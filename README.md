# TransportTimes
PSPH Efficiency Report
</br>
</br>
A certain department at my hospital is plagued by inefficiencies and is routinely backlogged 2-4 days. One proposal has been to decrease transport times to the lab by creating a special position. In this analysis I show that the major delay in care is less about transport times than previously hypothesized.
