# TransportTimes
PSPH Efficiency Report
</br>
</br>
A certain department at my hospital is plagued by inefficiencies and is routinely backlogged 2-4 days. One proposal has been to decrease transport arrival times by creating a special transport position that would only serve this department. In this analysis I show that the major delay in care is less about transport times than previously hypothesized.

New workflows have been created and tested based on this analysis with promising preliminary results. Full analysis will randomize the new workflow across sonographers and workdays, and is powered to detect differences between sonographers. Treatments have been randomized and assigned and are expected to finish in July.
